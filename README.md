### Installation
You need to install [**Node.js** (packaged with npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [**Redis**](https://redis.io/) for Faux to work.
You can learn how to start your own Redis server [here](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart). It's highly recommended to secure your Redis server with a password.  
Duplicate `_config.json` as `config.json`  
After that, you can run `npm i` in a terminal.

### Usage
This bot is designed to be built out of. You can add/change/remove any files towards your like.

Both `sharding.js` and `main.js` can be used to start the bot.  Alternatively, you can run `npm run start` to start the bot sharded and run `npm run start-noshard` to run without sharding.
